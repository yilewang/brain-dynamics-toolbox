### Preface

In the Fall 2022 semester, I took a class named "Neural Network Mathematics". In this class, Dr. Golden introduced many important concepts in probability theory, linear algebra, and differential equations. All these info are useful for learning more advanced knowledge about deep learning and computational neuroscience. By taking this course, I am way more comfortable to deal with math in the papers and my research now. During the winter vacation, I think it is a great opportunities to summarize what I have learnt in the past semester, and this markdown file could be a collection of
