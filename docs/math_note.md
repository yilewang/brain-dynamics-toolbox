### My Math Learning Note

*Author: Yile Wang*

How important math could be doesn't even need me to say it when you study computational neuroscience and biophysics. This md file will dedicate to my math learning journey from scratch.

First of first, my math background: I graduated from applied psychology major of a medical school in China, which means that I bascially have **Zero** math training before I started my graduate school. Well, probably I still remember something from my high school math class but whatever. 

In Fall 2022 semester, I enrolled into a machine learning math class and I realized how much I should learn before I could properly understand the concepts. With no surprise, I performed really bad in my first exam. However, I took it as an opportunity to seriously learn the real math for my research or for my personal pleasure ;)

This md file will be a "cheatsheet" to help me pick up what I have learnt before in a succinct and efficient way.

### Symbols

- number belongs to real number domain
$ X \in \mathbb{R} $; Also it could be used to indicate the size of the matrix: $X \in \mathbb{R^{d \times m}}$ matrix with d rows and m columns. The matrix is $\mathbf{A}$; The column vector is $\mathbf{a}$. 






### Calculus

#### Logarithm and Exponential

Logarithm is the inverse function of expoential. The basic property, $ \ln x = y $ and $ e^y = x $. One example: a: $a^{{log_{a}x}} =x $, $e^{\ln x} = x$. Another example: $log_a x = \frac{\ln x}  {\ln a}$. 

#### Limit


#### First Order Derivative


#### Taylor Series

Taylor series is a polynomial approximation method.

$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} C_k X^k$


#### Jacobian Matrix


#### strict local minimizer

be local minimizer: 

be strict local minimizer
It has to be twice differentiable; and $ x^* \in \mathbb{R^d} $ is a critical point of V.

critical point definition is: 


### Linear Algebra
