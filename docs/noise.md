### How Noise Affects the Synchronization Properties of Recurrent Networks of Inhibitory Neurons

First, single-neuron firing rates are typically much lower than LFPs. Two Properties are found: consistent irregularity, with findings of high variability in interspike intervals; Large fluctuation in membrane potentials

However, frequency of the population oscillation increase rapidly when **synaptic delay** decrease. It can be much larger than firing frequency of the neurons.

cluster state: noise and heterogeneities are weak. Spikes together in a narrow window of time. In such a state, the oscillation frequency is close to the average of the neurons. 

A rationale: populations of neurons are dynamic systems capable of displaying oscillatory behavior. 

when noise is present, a fluctuation can perturb the population from its equilibrium state, to which it then returns in a characteristic transient manner. 

The time delay should be considered

An example to understand why delay matters: two systems shall oscillate in a synchronous fashion at 10 Hz. Their coupling shall be such that it reinforces synchronous in-phase oscillation when no signal transmission delay exits. If the delay increases to 50 ms, then the previously stable synchronous oscillation may become unstable, because the transmitted signal from one oscillator arrives now during the antiphase of the other oscillator.
