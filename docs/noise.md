### How Noise Affects the Synchronization Properties of Recurrent Networks of Inhibitory Neurons

First, single-neuron firing rates are typically much lower than LFPs. Two Properties are found: consistent irregularity, with findings of high variability in interspike intervals; Large fluctuation in membrane potentials

However, frequency of the population oscillation increase rapidly when **synaptic delay** decrease. It can be much larger than firing frequency of the neurons.

cluster state: noise and heterogeneities are weak. Spikes together in a narrow window of time. In such a state, the oscillation frequency is close to the average of the neurons.
