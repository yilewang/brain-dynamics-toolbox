### M. Rubinov, O. Sporns, 2010, Complex network measures of brain connectivity: Uses and interpretations, NeuroImage.

Various measures can be used to detect functional **integration**, **segregation** and **centrality** of individual brain regions.


- Quantify brain networks with a small number of neurobiologically meaningful and easily computable measures
- Useful setting for exploring structural-functional connectivity relationship
- For brain disorders


### The definition of the network

A network is a mathematical representation of a real-world complex system, defined by nodes (vertices) and links (edges) between pairs of nodes.

- Anatomical connections: white matter tracts
- Functional connections: temporal correlations in activity
- Effective connections: direct or indirect causal influences of one region on another.

#### Nodes

It would be less meaningful to lump heterogeneously connected brain regions into single nodes.

Individual brain should not spatially overlap.

The properties will be distinctly different when using different parcellation schemes. Functional and structural networks are compared meaningfully as long as they have same parcellation scheme. 

#### Links
links are differentiated on the basis of their weight and directionality









### The python implementation

```python
import bctpy
```
